Abstract: Introduction
Epidermoid cysts are rare benign lesions of the central nervous system which accounts for approximately 1–2 % of all intracranial tumours. They are commonly located in the parasellar region, cerebellopontine angle; however, brain parenchyma origin is rare. We report clinicopathological features of these rare lesions.
Method and material
This is a retrospective study of epidermoid cyst of the brain diagnosed between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2020.
Results
The four patients had mean age of 30,8 years (range: 3–63), one male and 3 females. All four patients presented with headache and one associated with seizures. Radiological images showed two posterior fossa; each occipital and temporal locations. All tumours were successfully removed and histopathological assessment confirmed epidermoid cysts. All patients showed clinical improvement and were discharged home.
Conclusion
Epidermoid cysts of the brain are rare and still remain a preoperative clinico-radiological conundrum as they may be indistinguishable from other intracranial tumours. Therefore, collaboration with histopathologists is advised in the management of these cases.
