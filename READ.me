PYTHON BACKEND
- The backend uses APIs from Google Scholar, Google Trends, SarpAPI, ChatGPT and Firebase.
- Its purpose is to enable AI to write articles about trending topics as an attempt to overcome ChatGPT's database limit until 2021 while providing reliable data.
- The program is fully functional, however, still very unstable due to the API calls being limited and large latency between calls.
- The backbone of the server is a Flask application that is currently working locally on a loopback address.
- After Google and ChatGPT tools finish writing the article, they send it to a NoSQL database held on the Firebase server.
- Firebase is used later to display the computer generated articles to a mobile application.
- To enhance performance, the server uses web sockets which allow asynchronous API calls.
